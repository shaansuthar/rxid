# 💊 RxID

What do you get when you mix RFID technology with perscription management? RxID!
This innovative project allows users to store their perscriptions and medical histories on an RFID tag, and then use that tag at dispensers and in emergency situations. 


## 📽️ Demo Video
Check out the video below to see RxID in action!

## ❇️ Features
- **RFID Card:** connects users to a medical database storing information on their medical conditions and perscriptions. In case of emergency, medical staff can scan the tags and have instant access to their patient's key details.
- **Comprehensive Database**: allows medical professionals to view and edit your medical history and perscriptions, and allows you to keep up to date on your health and medications.  
- **Secure (and Fun!) Pill Dispensing:** a physical dispenser equipped with an internal hopper can release the exact number of pills the user needs, based on their perscription.  

## 🖥️ Technologies
- **Raspberry Pi**
- **Firebase**
- **RFID**

## 🔧 Mechanical Design
The dispenser mechanism is comprised of three 3D printed pieces, and a placeholder cardboard hopper. A disc with a slot is sized to hold one pill at a time, and rotates between a loading state and a dropping state. Attached is an animation of the mechanism created in SolidWorks.
